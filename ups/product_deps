# This @product_deps@ file defines dependencies for this package. 

# The *parent* line must the first non-commented line and defines this product and version
# The version must be of the form vxx_yy_zz (e.g. v01_02_03)
parent gm2geom v0_0_1

# The defaultqual should correspond to Art's default qualifier (e.g. a7)
defaultqual e4

# These optional lines define where headers, libraries, and executables go and should
# be used only if your product does not conform to the defaults.
# Format: directory_type directory_path directory_name
#   where directory_type is one of incdir, libdir, or bindir
#   where directory_path is one of product_dir, fq_dir and - 
# fcl_dir product_dir fcl/geom <-- Won't work


# With "product  version" table below, we now define depdendencies

# Add the dependent product and version
